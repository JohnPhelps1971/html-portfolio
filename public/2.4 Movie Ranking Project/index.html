<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Apocalypse Now</h3>
<p>The soundtrack and the atmosphere is simply amazing.</p>
<h3>Edge of tomorrow</h3>
<p>In terms of just never giving up, this is a great movie.<br />So much better than War of the Worlds, which is almost painful to watch with all the screaming.</p>
<h3>Man on Fire</h3>
<p>Fantastic movie - this is someone who takes their job seriously and gets things done. Dont mess with the nanny.</p>
